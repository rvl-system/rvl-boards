# RVL Controller Board

_**Note:**_ This board is still in development, and documentation is currently sparse.

The RVL controller board is a custom board that runs the [RVL Firmware](https://github.com/rvl-system/rvl-firmware), and is intended for use as both a development board and an LED controller. This board features:

- ESP32 dual core processor
- Compatible with 3 or 4 pin 5V LED strips supported by [FastLED](http://fastled.io/)
  - Solder jumper for switching between 3 and 4 pin headers (optional)
- Can be powered from USB, or can be "backfed" power from the LED strip connected to it
- 3.3V to 5V level translation on LED control pins
- An LCD and tiny 5-way joystick for controlling the device directly
- A 16-pin header, with GPIO, UART, JTAG, I2C, and ADC pins exposed
- Can be programmed using JTAG + [OpenOCD](https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/latest/api-guides/jtag-debugging/#jtag-debugging-setup-openocd) or UART + [esptool.py](https://github.com/espressif/esptool)
  - JTAG is the recommended way to interact with this device. The experience is a lot smoother, and you can also debug the device with breakpoints/variable inspection.
  - [RVL Firmware](https://github.com/rvl-system/rvl-firmware) includes a script that is preconfigured to use JTAG+OpenOCD with this device and the [FTDI C232HM-DDHSL-0](https://www.ftdichip.com/Products/Cables/USBMPSSE.htm) MSSPE cable 
  
## GPIO Header Pins

The GPIO header has the following layout:

<table>
  <tr>
    <td>TMS</td><td>TCK</td><td>GND</td><td>26</td><td>25</td><td>18</td><td>23</td><td>VCC</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>TDI</td><td>TDO</td><td>RXD</td><td>TXD</td><td>27</td><td>5</td><td>19</td><td>GND</td>
  </tr>
</table>

Each pin has the following functionality*:

| TCK | GPIO13, ADC2_CH4, TOUCH4, RTC_GPIO14, MTCK, HSPID, HS2_DATA3, SD_DATA3, EMAC_RX_ER |
| TDO | GPIO15, ADC2_CH3, TOUCH3, MTDO, HSPICS0, RTC_GPIO13, HS2_CMD, SD_CMD, EMAC_RXD3 |
| GND | Ground (shown as EN in the photo, but has been changed in the most recent revision) |
| RXD | GPIO3, U0RXD, CLK_OUT2 |
| 26  | GPIO26, DAC_2, ADC2_CH9, RTC_GPIO7, EMAC_RXD1 |
| TXD | GPIO1, U0TXD, CLK_OUT3, EMAC_RXD2 |

| 23  | GPIO23, GPIO23, HS1_STROBE, VSPID/VSPIMOSI |
| 18  | GPIO18, GPIO18, HS1_DATA7, VSPICLK |
| 19  | GPIO19, GPIO19, U0CTS, VSPIQ/VSPMISO, EMAC_TXD0 |
| 5  | GPIO5, GPIO5, HS1_DATA6, VSPICS0, EMAC_RX_CLK |
| VCC | 3.3 volt power (limited to 500mA total including CPU) |
| GND | Ground  |
